## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
1. (which variables/coefficients provided a non-fandom amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?)
2. No, the slope of the linear model should not be considered to be zero as the slope of the linear model is composed by five different values according to the screen capture below.  
3. It can be observed that from R-squared value (Multiple R-squared: 0.7149, Adjusted R-squared: 0.6825) reasonably explains a decent percentage of data points could describe such dependent results through this linear model. Therefore, the linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar pototypes effectively.
